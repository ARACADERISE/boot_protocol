## What is boot.yaml?
<p><b><u>boot.yaml</u></b> stores information over a <i>possible</i> second-stage binary file and a <i>required</i> kernel binary file(second-stage bootloader in C is optional).</br>This file simply just makes the protocols life easier. It allows the protocol to take all the data from the file itself, store it and then reference it to fill out the formats it has correctly.</br></p>
