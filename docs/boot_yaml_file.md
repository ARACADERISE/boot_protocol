## What is boot.yaml?
<p><b><u>boot.yaml</u></b> stores information over a <i>possible</i> second-stage binary file and a <i>required</i> kernel binary file(second-stage bootloader in C is optional). It also stores information over the source-code file of the second-stage bootloader C code(if there is any) and the kernel C code, alongside the address iof the second-stage bootloader C code(if there is one) and the kernel code.</br>This file simply just makes the protocols life easier. It allows the protocol to take all the data from the file itself, store it and then reference it to fill out the formats it has correctly.</br></p>
