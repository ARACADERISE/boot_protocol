    - Added linker directory to `boot_protocol`
    - Added `linker.ld` and `kernel.ld` to `linker` directory
    - 1
        - See `todo` for more info
    - `boot.yaml` is now located in the parent directory of the OS code, not the inside the `boot_protocol` directory
    - 3
        - See `todo` for more info

    - Added `quick_edit.py`, a Python script that quickly fills out/writes the formats for the linker script 
      and fills out the format for `gdt_ideals.s`
    - Binary files are now created before the configuration of the MBR, user-makefile, protocol makefile and whatever else
      gets configured via `main.c`
    - Added `ss_linker_format` - A linker-script format for the second-stage bootloader
        - Furthermore, we implied the requirement of second-stage bootloader being loaded in at physical address 0x7E00, regardless
    - Added `kern_linker_format` - A linker-script format for the kernel
        - 1
            - See `todo` for more info
    - If there is a second-stage bootloader(`has_second_stage` has the value "yes"), the protocol now makes sure the according information
      is given
        - 2
            - See `todo` for more info

    - Linker scripts no longer manually put a byte after the last byte of the sector
        - With this, `format.c` pads out all binary files to 512 byte blocks(sectors)
    - Fixed `clean.py`. It wasn't deleting all .bin, .o and .out files within the binary folder
    - Programmers now have to tell the protocol the folder of where the binary files are located. This is done via `bin_folder`
        - 1
            - See `todo` for more info
    - Linker scripts are as-is. The protocol does not tweak with the linker scripts.
        - As of current, the protocol loads kernel at 0x9000.
        - This will change when the protocol is mature enough to do paging(for higher-half kernel)
    - `quick_edit.py` now only writes to `boot_protocol/gdt/gdt_ideals.s`, as well as checks if all the required data exists
